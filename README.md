<!-- # Making a bar chart in d3

Today I followed a [Curran Kelleher](https://www.youtube.com/user/currankelleher)'s tutorial on how to make a bar chart with d3.js

## What I learned?

1. <code>d3.select</code> is used to select an element from the document.
2. <code>d3.csv</code> is used to load a csv data which will get converted to javascript object.
3. <code>d3.scaleLiner</code> is used to create a liner scale which takes two methods: <code>domain([arg1, arg2])</code> <code>range([arg1, arg2])</code>
4. <code>d3.scaleBand</code> is used for **ordinal** attributes. (In this example it is used map each bar to a country name).
5. In this project <code>scaleLinear</code> is used to create xScale (population) and <code>scaleBand</code> is used to create yScale (bar vertical height). -->
